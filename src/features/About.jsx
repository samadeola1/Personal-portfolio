          I am a front-end developer based in Sydney looking for exciting
          opportunities. Has Mechanical Engineering background. Likes to focus
          on accessibility when developing. Passionate and curious about solving
          problems. Currently, Iâ€™m exploring Reactjs, Webflow and a bit of
          Designing. While I am not programming, I enjoy playing football,
          photography and playing Valorant. Learning more to improve skill.
